## Professional Life

My [LinkedIn Profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rishirajpravahan)

I am currently the **CEO of AnomalousDL**, a startup based out of Palo Alto, California. I co-founded AnomalousDL with my friend and mentor, [Amir Farbin](https://www.uta.edu/physics/faculty/farbin-amir.php). 

At [AnomalousDL](https://www.anomalousdl.com/), we built a high level Deep Learning framework capable of automating complicated scientific inqueries and developed specialized algorithms for anomaly detection on time series, network, transactional and image data. We are using the capabilities now to solve problems in healthcare. AnomalousDL's unsupervised algorithms find not only known unknowns but also unknown unknown with high sensitivity and precision. 

We are now revenue positive and bootstrapped and are always ready to help clients with their problems with our capabilities and services.

I also co-founded and became the director of INQNET at the AT&T Foundry in Palo Alto. INQNET (INtelligent Quantum Network and Technology) was founded to establish the first metropolitan scale quantum entanglement distribution system using AT&T's existing optical fiber network.
